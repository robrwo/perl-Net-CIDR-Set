# NAME

Net::CIDR::Set - Manipulate sets of IP addresses

# SYNOPSIS

```perl
use Net::CIDR::Set;

my $priv = Net::CIDR::Set->new( '10.0.0.0/8', '172.16.0.0/12',
  '192.168.0.0/16' );
for my $ip ( @addr ) {
  if ( $priv->contains( $ip ) ) {
    print "$ip is private\n";
  }
}
```

# DESCRIPTION

`Net::CIDR::Set` represents sets of IP addresses and allows standard
set operations (union, intersection, membership test etc) to be
performed on them.

In spite of the name it can work with sets consisting of arbitrary
ranges of IP addresses - not just CIDR blocks.

Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are handled - but they may not be mixed in
the same set. You may explicitly set the personality of a set:

```perl
my $ip4set = Net::CIDR::Set->new({ type => 'ipv4 }, '10.0.0.0/8');
```

Normally this isn't necessary - the set will guess its personality from
the first data that is added to it.
